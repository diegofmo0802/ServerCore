        }
      });
      // example 2
      const server = new ServerCore();
      server.config.port = 80;
      server.config.host = 'localhost';
      server.config.ssl = {
        pubKey: 'public.pem',

    // to
    $(name) { the key is %key% with value %value% }
    $(name, customKeyName, customValueName) { the key is %customKeyName% with value %customValueName% }
    ```
